# Privacy Policy

## Collection of Routine Information

This app does not track any information about our users. This means that we DO NOT track IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. However, this extension does temporarily store sensitive information from Open AI, namely, your Open AI JWT that is generated once you authenticate into their app. We do not send this JWT to any server or store this JWT in any database. It is simply used client-side.

## Cookies

## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

Nozee does not serve any advertisements.


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
