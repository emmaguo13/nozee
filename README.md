## Introduction

Nozee aims to showcase the power and potential of zero-knowledge proofs in user authentication. By utilizing JWTs, the application demonstrates how users can authenticate themselves without revealing sensitive information to the server.

The project is built with Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications. Additionally, Circom circuits are employed to provide zero-knowledge proofs, enabling secure and private authentication.

## Installation

To run Nozee locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/nozee.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nozee`
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`

## Usage

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), allowing you to access the application in your browser.
